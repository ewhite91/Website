<h1>The Best Movies According to Evan.</h1>

<h2>My top three movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>While this is technically a trilogy, I would consider each vital to telling the overall story. 
    So, I will list this as one movie. This is probably my favorite movie as it tries to stay true to the books.
    In doing so it creates an amazing story. While the movies are about 20 years old now, I feel they have aged very well.
    The movies have great acting, writing, cinematography, soundtrack, and to this day decent special effects. What makes
    the story so good is the themes throughout the series.</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie comes from a short story by Steven King, and while he is known for horror novels, this movie is anything but that. 
    It is a story about a successful man who is sent to prison for killing his wife, though it is suggested early on that he did not do it, 
    and to which he claims innocence. The story is about his time in prison and how he makes friends and uses his 
    knowledge in business and finance to move up in prison and seek a way out. The movie truly is about his redemption, as far as cinema goes 
    it is almost flawless. Many people consider this one of the best if not the best movie ever made.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p> While it is hard to really pick three favorites and it is almost a toss-up for them, I think I would give the third movie to
    The Dark Knight. Other than being a good movie, I think the reason I like this one so much is because 
    it was a comic book movie that took a comic and made it not feel like complete fiction. While it still is 
    fictional and has some unrealistic parts to it, the movie still feels very possible and believable. The story, the acting
    writing, the soundtrack, and the characters are all done perfectly. It presents a villain who has no motivation 
    other than he just likes chaos, and this presents a villain who cannot be reasoned with. The actor who portrays
    him did an amazing job.
